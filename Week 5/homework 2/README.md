Tests I added are:

## test_total_amount

Adds all the items into the shopping cart and then calculates the total amount, checks the website gives the same amount.

## test_add_to_cart

Takes the parameter "n_items", adds n many items into the shopping cart and checks if the text of the shopping cart is changed to the number n.


## test_shopping_cart

Takes the parameter "n_items", adds n many items into the shopping cart and clicks on the shopping cart to view the shopping cart. Checks if the same
amount of items are there aswell. Then clicks on the remove items and checks if the item count is 0.
